Deliberative Diversity
======================

``Exposure Diversity`` is an algorithm that implements a deliberative diversity model by providing news articles from a wide range of topics and viewpoints.
It emphasizes party visibility, particularly of minority parties, to enhance public awareness and to foster a more inclusive understanding of political discourse.
In each news recommendation list, articles with majority and minority views are displayed in the order of the interval set by the user.
For example, if the interval parameter is set to 3, when generating the recommendation list, the model will extract 3 articles with the majority of views, followed by 3 articles with the minority of views, and then repeat this operation until the recommendation list is filled.

The ``Deliberative Diversity`` algorithm is based on the articles of the majority party and the minority party, and the user's attributes.
It requires the user to pre-configure the party attributes and the user's political type (a random assignment strategy is adopted in this project, that is, randomly assigning a political type to the user).
The continuous exposure length of majority party articles and minority party articles, political articles, and non-political articles is controlled by parameters to increase the diversity of recommendation results.

For the code, please see the `EPD implementation <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders/tree/main/cornac/models/epd>`_ in the repository.

  This tutorial outlines part of the workflow for the `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_ repository.
  The `Recommenders Pipeline <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommenders.html>`_ provides an overview of all components.

Overview
--------

EPD requires an annotated set with political parties.
At the beginning of an experiment, users are assigned to one of three conditions:
1. exposed to news on the majority parties, 
2. exposed to minority party news, or 
3. exposed to other political news.

Articles in the majority party's news must mention at least one majority/governing party, and they must not mention any minority or opposition party.
Minority party news feature at least one minority/opposition party.
(Majority and minority parties are determined with respect to the source of the news.)
Other political news consists of articles on political topics, not mentioning any majority or minority parties (this also includes mentions of any foreign parties).
The list size of EPD determined the number of recommended articles, with a slice value used for grouping and interleaving non-political articles.

E.g., with a list size of 20 and a slice value of 2, users in the minority party condition receive two minority party articles, followed by two non-political articles.
This is repeated until 20 articles are added to the feed.
The news supply to EPD assumes items are from the most recent day.
Articles get shuffled before being added to a recommendation list.
This is done to avoid any outlet-based clustering, as articles are scraped one outlet at a time.

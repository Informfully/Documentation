Recommender System
==================

This documentation provides an outline and tutorial on how to use `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_.
We recommend you start getting familiar with the underlying data first.
To do so, we prepared two overview pages.
Please see the `collection overview <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compass.html>`_ for details on how to retrieve the relevant user/item IDs.
The details on how to store items and their properties are documented in the `item overview <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/items.html>`_.

.. note::

  This tutorial outlines the `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_ repository. 
  It can be used in combination with the Informfully platfrom or in a stand-alone component.
  You can skip to the `relevant documentation <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations.html>`_ on how to forward recommendation lists to the Informfully front end if you are using your own recommender system.

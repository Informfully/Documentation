`Google Play Store (for Android devices) <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.uzh.ifi.news>`_
Devices with at least Android 5.1

`Apple App Store (for iOS devices) <https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/ddis-news/id1460234202>`_
Devices with at least iOS 13.0

.. note::

    Theoretically, the mobile app should be supported by devices with iOS 11.0.
    However, `TestFlight <https://developer.apple.com/testflight/>`_ (which was used for testing the beta version of the app) is only supported by devices with minimum iOS 13.0.
    Therefore, we could not test whether the mobile app is actually compatible with iOS 11.0.

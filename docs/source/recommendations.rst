Recommendation Lists
====================

This page provides information on how to populate the ``recommendationLists`` `data collection <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html>`_ in the back end and based on `user and item data <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compass.html>`_.
The `relevant code <https://github.com/Informfully/Documentation/tree/main/sample>`_ is shared separately.

.. note::

  This tutorial outlines part of the workflow for the `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_ repository.
  The `Recommenders Pipeline <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommenders.html>`_ provides an overview of all components.
  And you can look at the `Tutorial Notebook <https://github.com/Informfully/Experiments/tree/main/experiments/tutorial>`_ for hands-on examples of everything outlined here.

Informfully uses a JSON Recommendation Exchange Format (JREX) to visualize iteem recommendations.
JREX allows you to add recommendations for any user containing any item that is your document collection.
It allows for specifying the following properties of the recommendation list:

..
  ID (ObjectID): Unique Object ID used for indexing.
  userID (String): ID of the user.
  itemID (String): ID of the item.
  prediction (Double): Prediction score that determines the position of the item within the recommendation list. The higher the score, the further up the item is placed in the news feed. Precision, upper, and lower limits of the score can be customized.
  recommendationAlgorithm (String): Algorithm used to calculate the recommendation. Can optionally include an explanation of why this item was recommended.
  isPreview (Boolean): The front end can display (or feature) items in a preview mode (with the item text and image across the entire screen. Alternatively, items can be shown using a downsized image with a square aspect ratio and title-only.
  createdAt (Date): Timestamp that records when the item recommendation was created.

     - Type
     - Description
   * - ``_id``
     - ObjectID
     - Unique Object ID used for indexing.
   * - ``userID``
     - String
     - ID of the user.
   * - ``itemID``
     - String
     - ID of the item.
   * - ``prediction``
     - Double
     - Prediction score that determines the position of the item within the recommendation list. The higher the score, the further up the item is placed in the news feed. Precision, upper- and lower limits of the score can be customized.
   * - ``recommendationAlgorithm``
     - String
     - Algorithm used to calculate the recommendation. Can optionally include an explanation of why this item was recommended.
   * - ``isPreview``
     - Boolean
     - If set to TRUE, the front end displays items in a preview mode (with the item text and image across the entire screen). If set to FALSE, items are shown using a downsized image (with a square aspect ratio and title-only).
   * - ``createdAt``
     - Date
     - Timestamp that records when the item recommendation was created.

Below, you find a reference implementation of how, starting with item and user pools, such a JREX list of recommendations is created using the function ``create_recommendation()``.
(If you are unfamiliar with MongoDB and how to retrieve user and itemd IDs, please see the `MongoDB tutorial page <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compass.html>`_ on how to retrieve them.)
Again, you can use the `reference implementation <https://github.com/Informfully/Documentation/tree/main/sample>`_ mentioned above to turn the user-item recommendations into JREX.

        algorithm_name = "Default Algorithm"

        # Create sample recommendations for all users
        recommendation_list = assign_articles(user_pool, article_pool, algorithm_name)

        # Export recommendation list to JSON
        write_recommendations(recommendation_list)

    # Run example
    main()

By default, the front end requires the output of this function to be stored in a document collection with the name ``recommendationLists``.
The name of the collection can be changed (`see codebase <https://github.com/Informfully/Platform/blob/main/backend/imports/api/recommendations.js>`_).

The workflow for managing the recommendation list is left open.
For example, updating recommendations for a given user can be done by simply inserting new recommendations with a higher prediction score.
This will to preserve existing/old entries and moves them to the bottom of the recommendation list.
Alternatively, all existing items for a given user can removed before updating the list to make sure that only new items are shown.
To preserve the recommendation history, this second approach would require moving old recommendations to a separate collection before each update.

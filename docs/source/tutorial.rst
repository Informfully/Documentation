Tutorial Notebook
=================

.. note::

  This tutorial outlines the `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_ repository. 
  It can be used in combination with the Informfully platfrom or in a stand-alone component.
  You can skip to the `relevant documentation <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations.html>`_ on how to forward recommendation lists to the Informfully front end if you are using your own recommender system.

Work in progress...

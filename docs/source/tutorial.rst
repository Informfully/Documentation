Tutorial Notebook
=================

.. note::

  This tutorial outlines the `Informfully Recommenders <https://github.com/Informfully/Recommenders>`_ repository. 
  It can be used in combination with the Informfully platfrom or in a stand-alone component.
  You can skip to the `relevant documentation <https://informfully.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations.html>`_ on how to forward recommendation lists to the Informfully front end if you are using your own recommender system.
  Note that the examples given here are for the news domain, but you can use any text, image, audio, or video files.

Work in progress...
